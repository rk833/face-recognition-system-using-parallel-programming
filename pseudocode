ALGORITHM DynamicParallelFaceRecognition

    LOAD known face image
    EXTRACT known face encoding

    SCAN image folder
    FILTER valid image files

    GET available CPU cores
    DETERMINE optimal number of workers and chunk size 
        based on dataset size and cores

    ANALYSE workload distribution

    CREATE process pool with optimal workers
    PARALLEL MAP ProcessSingleImage to all filenames 
        USING calculated chunk size

    COLLECT results
    REMOVE all None values

    DISPLAY matched filenames
    DISPLAY total time and performance statistics

END ALGORITHM
